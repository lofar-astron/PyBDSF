"""PyBDSF options

Options are essentially user-controllable parameters passed into PyBDSF
operations, and allow for end-users to control the exact details of how
calculations are done.

The doc string should give a short description of the option, followed by a
line break ('\n') then a long, detailed description. The short description can
then be split off using "str(v.doc()).split('\n')[0]".

The group string can be used to group suboptions under a parent option.  The
group string should be the name of the parent option, which must be Bool
(except for the "hidden" group, which will suppress listing of the option; the
option can still be set as normal).

In general it's better to specify newly added options directly in this file, so
one can oversee them all. But it's also possible to extend it at run-time, and
under some circumstances (e.g. pybdsf installed system-wide, and there is no
way to modify this file) this might be the only option to do so. An example of
such extension follows:

==== file newmodule.py ====
from image import Op

class Op_new_op(Op):
    ## do something useful here
    ## we need to add option my_new_opt
    pass

## this will extend Opts class at runtime and ensure that
## type-checking works properly.
