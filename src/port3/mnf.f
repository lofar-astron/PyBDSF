C  ***  PURPOSE  ***
C
C        THIS ROUTINE INTERACTS WITH SUBROUTINE   RMNF  IN AN ATTEMPT
C     TO FIND AN N-VECTOR  X*  THAT MINIMIZES THE (UNCONSTRAINED)
C     OBJECTIVE FUNCTION COMPUTED BY  CALCF.  (OFTEN THE  X*  FOUND IS
C     A LOCAL MINIMIZER RATHER THAN A GLOBAL ONE.)
C
C  ***  PARAMETERS  ***
C
C        THE PARAMETERS FOR   MNF ARE THE SAME AS THOSE FOR   MNG
C     (WHICH SEE), EXCEPT THAT CALCG IS OMITTED.  INSTEAD OF CALLING
C     CALCG TO OBTAIN THE GRADIENT OF THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION AT X,
C       MNF CALLS  S7GRD, WHICH COMPUTES AN APPROXIMATION TO THE
C     GRADIENT BY FINITE (FORWARD AND CENTRAL) DIFFERENCES USING THE
C     METHOD OF REF. 1.  THE FOLLOWING INPUT COMPONENT IS OF INTEREST
C     IN THIS REGARD (AND IS NOT DESCRIBED IN   MNG).
C
C V(ETA0)..... V(42) IS AN ESTIMATED BOUND ON THE RELATIVE ERROR IN THE
C             OBJECTIVE FUNCTION VALUE COMPUTED BY CALCF...
C                  (TRUE VALUE) = (COMPUTED VALUE) * (1 + E),
C             WHERE ABS(E) .LE. V(ETA0).  DEFAULT = MACHEP * 10**3,
C             WHERE MACHEP IS THE UNIT ROUNDOFF.
C
C        THE OUTPUT VALUES IV(NFCALL) AND IV(NGCALL) HAVE DIFFERENT
C     MEANINGS FOR   MNF THAN FOR   MNG...
C
C IV(NFCALL)... IV(6) IS THE NUMBER OF CALLS SO FAR MADE ON CALCF (I.E.,
C             FUNCTION EVALUATIONS) EXCLUDING THOSE MADE ONLY FOR
C             COMPUTING GRADIENTS.  THE INPUT VALUE IV(MXFCAL) IS A
C             LIMIT ON IV(NFCALL).
C IV(NGCALL)... IV(30) IS THE NUMBER OF FUNCTION EVALUATIONS MADE ONLY
C             FOR COMPUTING GRADIENTS.  THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FUNCTION
C             EVALUATIONS IS THUS  IV(NFCALL) + IV(NGCALL).
